# A Guide to the Barbell Back Squat
This is an "instruction set" written for my technical writing class. In writing the instruction set, I had to make sure to establish an understanding of potential audiences and use appropriate rhetorical devices for clear and effective communication. Since I've been working out consistently for a few years, I felt qualified in making a guide for the back squat. The project was made entirely in google docs - you can access the entire project by cloning the repository above.
